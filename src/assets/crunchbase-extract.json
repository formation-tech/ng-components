Each of these events, also known as blobs are composed of media ( photos, videos, text ) and relations ( people, place, interests, timelines, other things you care about ). Every relation in lifeblob is represented as a timeline - the interesting thing about these timelines is that they are connected with each other.</p>\n\n<p>An example to show how this works - If you come back from a trip with your friends, you can make a post on your timeline and add your friends as participants. This immediately causes the post to show up on your timeline and also the timelines of your friends. Add to it that you were in Las Vegas and the post also starts showing up on the Las Vegas timeline.</p>\n\n<p>This builds an interesting social structure where as your friends and family add posts to their timelines, those relevant to you become a part of your timeline automatically. It also turns on interesting discovery mechanisms where if you are planning to visit a place, you can meet people who have been there or live there on the place timeline and connect with them.</p>\n\n<p>Timelines can be used to map your personal life, showcase achievements of your company, keep a runbook of events of your community and educational purposes too.</p>"

The company headquarters are today located in Cork while operational headquarters are in Shenzhen, South China with a US headquarters in San Francisco.</p>\n\n<p>The development of PCH saw a criss-cross of activity across the globe from Donoughmore, Co. Cork in Ireland to Shenzhen, Guangdong Province in China. The journey saw Liam Casey start his career in fashion retail with Tricot Marine, moving to the United States to work for a trading company, before finally landing in Shenzhen, China. The company was named after the Pacific Coast Highway, in memory of Casey&#8217;s time living in California. During his time in the United States, Casey worked for a trading company that imported from China. After visiting the country and witnessing the quality and work ethic of Chinese manufacturers, he spotted an opportunity to match Chinese manufacturing with western markets. In 2007, Liam Casey was named Ernst &amp; Young Irish Entrepreneur of the Year achieving a major milestone in the development of PCH.</p>\n\n<p>Services</p>\n\n<p>PCH offers a complete package of bespoke product development and commerce solutions that can be fully customised to meet the requirements of clients&#8217; global business strategies.

It equips startups with the knowledge and know-how to de-risk and become a hardware company that investors want to invest in.

The base LLC is Vehicle Environmental Solutions (VES) will establish a state-of-the-art indoor, environmentally benign, semi-automated automobile reclamation facility, capable of processing up to 20 thousand (per shift) end-of-life automobiles per annum, and produce substantial concentrations of reclaimed component materials and parts. The semi-automated disassembly line is patented and operational in 4 locations in Europe. SDH Group intends on purchasing the patents and company that produces the disassembly line and is in negotiations with the owners. The other developed and planned LLC work as &#8220;cousins&#8221; to VES. An example is Pt-Rh, LLC which was developed to extract and refine the three types of Platinum that are used in all catalytic converters. This company alone in its first year of operation could generate $20 million in profits. Other companies include Used Tire Solutions and Global Plastic Recycling as two more &#8220;cousins&#8221; in generating revenues for SDH Group.</p>\n\n<p>Issues\nThere are more than 50 million automobiles manufactured per year in the United States, with in excess of 13 million automobiles that are reaching the end of their useful life each year and this trend seems to be growing every year. Far more than 10 million vehicles are scrapped annually in one form or another, in the United States alone. Most of these automobiles end up in junkyards, where employees, with little regard for environmental impact, partially dismantle vehicles to satisfy individual customer orders. The remaining hulk (an industry term) is usually sent off to a scrap dealer (shredder). Shredders are primarily interested in getting rid of the vehicle and their process is very unfriendly to the environment. The yards place each vehicle into the machine which, of course, shreds the vehicle. Seeing that they do not disassemble the vehicle, the shreddings are mixed and therefore contaminated and cannot be utilized for recycling. In all cases, the hulk contains significant amounts of materials/parts that, if reclaimed in large quantities, separated and generically identified, would have enhanced value.</p>\n\n<p>Marketing, Sales and Customers\nThere is a supply and demand issue with this type of environmental recycling. On the supply side, SDH Group has been in talks with two major automobile insurance companies.  Aside from a formal contract, it has been agreed that SDH/VES will accept all the insurance companies&#8217; end of life vehicles (ELV), which will average approximately 300 automobiles per week. On the demand side, SDH/VES has lined up buyers for approximately 98% of all auto parts, metals, plastics, glass harvested. Approximate gross value per vehicle is $1,700. One shift can disassemble up to 800 ELV per month.</p>\n\n<p>Competition\nIn the United States, the automobile reclamation industry is ad hock and fragmented. The few attempts to consolidate have failed because no economies of scale resulted from the roll-ups (e.g.: Ford&#8217;s Greenleaf program, LKQ - a CarMax affiliate, and Parts America.) The VES systems technology approach is a needed fundamental change to the industry. The existing markets and emerging new markets, for reclaimed automotive materials and parts are constantly looking for a one-stop-shop, because the costs are less. There is a supply and a large demand for these used auto parts and scrap metals, plastics and glass.</p>\n\n<p>Other Potential Business/Technological Acquisitions:\nAs noted, SDH Group continually seeks emerging products, processes and technologies in the areas of reclamation, resource recovery and energy alternatives, so to develop into commercial ventures. The following are three possibilities where extensive research has been accomplished and the companies/technologies can be obtained:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>SDH Group is currently in Joint Venture talks with a California engineering company that has developed a system to extract the three types of platinum in catalytic converters and refining these metals to 99% purity. This patented process could generate and additional $20,000,000 (net) in the first year, just in platinum sales.</li>\n<li>Crude Oil Emulsions is a naturally occurring sludge that oil drillers must remove at the well. This sludge is often used power generation at power plants or burn in industrial kilns. However, much of this sludge is just left into pools for disposal. SDH Group could purchase the technology that would separate the sludge back into pipeline grade crude oil, water and clean sentiment.</li>\n<li>SDH Group has just begun talks with an engineer that has developed a system that would make any automobile a hybrid-electric vehicle for under $10,000 each. </li>\n<li>VES will generate millions of pounds of scrap tires per year. SDH Group has found a system that could be used in recycling the elements within tires into a diesel fuel.</li>\n<li>SDH Group is in negotiations to purchase the company that owns the patents on the disassembly line that will be utilized at all VES locations.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Exit Strategy\nThe exit strategy will include SDH Group will include filing a Form 10 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which will give the company fully-reporting status. Once approved, SDH Group will file a 15c211 with FINRA (formerly the NASD) and become a fully trading company. SDH Group will initially be trading on the OTC.BB, but will transfer to the American Exchange (AMEX) as soon as possible. This process will allow SDH Group to raise additional capital for further expansion. SDH Group plans on filing with the SEC by the end of September or early October 2008 and raise approximately $10,000,000 upon approval.</p>"

      "<p>PocketNumerix builds financial power tools for Pocket PC and Windows Mobile platforms.</p>\n\n<p>The product portfolio currently includes analytical portfolio managers, support applications, and subscription services.  NillaHedge is the star of the show, managing a portfolio of stocks and options, with supporting functionality provided by StrategyExplorer and YieldCurveFitter.  BondManager provides analogous functionality for a portfolio of bonds, also supported by YieldCurveFitter.  The applications are priced like graphical calculators, yet offer analytics used by professional fund managers.</p>\n\n<p>NillaHedge&#8217;s OptionAnalyzer computes implied volatility, the probability of closing in the money, elasticity, and a half-dozen Black-Scholes greeks.  Its HedgeExplorer allows users to scroll through graphical realizations of the profit profile for every possible option spread and stock hedge drawn on an underlying stock.  Three more graphical tools provide insight into the performance of the option portfolio and individual options with respect to time, the risk free rate, and the underlying stock&#8217;s volatility, in the TimeDecayExplorer, RateSensitivityExplorer, and VolatilityValueExplorer.</p>\n\n<p>Similarly, BondManager includes a BondAnalyzer that computes current yield, yield to maturity, Macaulay duration, modified duration, convexity, and imputed value at a given change in spot market yield.  BondManager&#8217;s RateSensitivityExplorer facilitates an understanding of how the existing portfolio and individual issues will respond to changes in market yields.</p>\n\n<p>Both NillaHedge and BondManager include PortfolioNavigator and PositionTranscripts.  PortfolioNavigator facilitates browsing open positions in the form of a folding spreadsheet.  PositionTranscripts makes it easy to export a calendar year of transactions for tax purposes.</p>\n\n<p>StrategyExplorer is a tool for planning option spreads and stock hedges, thus supporting NillaHedge.</p>\n\n<p>YieldCurveFitter is a support tool for fitting yield curves, with serveral uses.  It computes the spot rate of interest used by NillaHedge as the risk free rate and a rational yield curve given a set of yields, like the U.S. Treasury Bill rates.  Fixed income investors watch the &#8216;risk free&#8217; U.S. T-bill rate curve so they can assess premiums offered by other instruments over the T-bill yield curve.</p>\n\n<p>A StockManager is brewing which will scatterplot stocks in volatility-return space, allowing users to rapidly identify issues with high Sharpe ratios.  StockManager will also include a PortfolioEvaluator that computes the maximum return portfolio at a given tolerance for risk and juxtaposes the user&#8217;s portfolio weights and Value-at-Risk against results for the mean-variance optimized portfolio.</p>\n\n<p>Feedback is welcome - the About page provides a means for submitting suggestions on a variety of subjects.</p>"

      "<p>Green Plug brings about a much needed revolution in the way we power electronic products. Today, dozens of consumer electronics (CE products) require external power adapters and battery chargers. Unfortunately, there is no common interface that will provide for interoperability and reusability, convenience, savings and the reduction of unnecessary components that wind up as eWaste because power adapters are normally thrown away when they are in perfect working condition. That&#8217;s not sustainable. That&#8217;s poor economics. And, Green Plug has changed this for the better.</p>\n\n<p>Green Plug is the first developer of digital technology that enables real-time collaboration between electronic devices and their power sources. Billions of devices including laptops, printers, speakers, routers, modems, cell phones, entertainment devices, power tools, cameras and so many other portable electronic devices require a power source that converts between 90V and 254V wall power to device-specific DC power. That means that these devices require unique power converters, and that is very costly, is extremely inconvenient and contributes to wasted resources and pollution.</p>\n\n<p>Greentalk(TM)-enabled intelligent power supplies, however, communicate with electronic devices and negotiate device power requirements for all devices connected to them. All cables and connectors are uniform; so, they work with any device! Being intelligent power sources, they eliminate wasted &#8220;phantom power&#8221; (power that is wasted when chargers are plugged in and either connected to devices that are fully charged or have no devices connected to them.) Greentalk provides an API for power monitoring and reporting applications as well as advanced control built upon 2-way communication. </p>"

Vengeo is a social-media-enhancement suite of integrated marketing tools including, Web Page publishing, Email Blasting, Surveys/Forms, BlogCommenting &amp; Chatting, Calendars, Subscriptions, File Transfer, and Content collaboration, with many unique advantages, compared to any other online tools.   Our one-price &#8216;one-stop-shop&#8217; model competes against other entrenched one-product models, such as for Web Pages the competitors might be: Squarespace, Sitemasher, WordPress, Joomla, Vista, Webstarts, Weebly, and while others may offer some overlap in web page production, unfortunately they are missing many of the other tools, as is the case for our many other  proprietary communication tools that are similar to Mail Chimp, iContact or Constant Contact, Survey Monkey, Form Maker, DropBox/YouSendIt, Google Calendar, EventBrite, PowerPoint, etc, all have singular capabilities.  </p>\n\n<p>We&#8217;re like the Swiss Army knife of social media tools.  Our pricing is all-inclusive, with unified data on secure Canadian Servers away from prying eyes, unified login, unified accounts payable, and equivalent to just ONE third-party tool, for the entire year!</p>\n\n<p>And because we can deliver most of our tools as web links, or embedded into our proprietary web page publishing tools, or supplied as HTML iFrame Plugins, our clients can deliver content in places and ways they couldn&#8217;t before, while organically increasing their SEO results without added costs - our clients tell us we cannot be beat!</p>\n\n<p>Now, we are starting to aggregate 3rd-party tools including Web Hosting (draft agreement with Canadian Web Hosting), e-Commerce, Teleconferencing, CRM, Hiring Tools, and looking to build APIs for several others.</p>\n\n<p>We also have a &#8216;Sharepoint&#8217; style hierarchical community management system (multi managers-subordinates) that permits &#8216;super members&#8217; to create virtual Projects/Communities to collaborate/approve on all their sub members&#8217; content.  </p>\n\n<p>Our system can be used as a standalone &#8216;total access&#8217; tool-suite, or as a broader &#8216;baby&#8217; Content Management Solution (CMS) for companies that can’t afford the big price but need the basics, and as a &#8216;baby&#8217; Learning Management Solution (LMS) for education, competing against much larger systems&#8230;we can drop-in Vengeo as an enterprise solution. </p>\n\n<p>Our primary focus is Small Business, NFPs, and Education where schools will pay a different pricing model for an enterprise solution. The typical Small Business plan is priced at $588 to $1188 per year, compared to the same cost for ONE single competing tool. All the tools are blended into each member’s account to give any organization a low-cost high-value suite of tools, at ready access without the client’s extra time for research, expense.  </p>\n\n<p>We have over 900 beta free users but recently went into revenue March 2012, very quickly selling 2 dozen SMBs, with over 60 in the funnel. In addition, we&#8217;re starting to scale, now in discussion with a few business communities as well as with education pilots in 3 Ontario colleges and the entire country of El Salvador&#8217;s Ministry of Education. </p>\n\n<p>Visit our website www.vengeo.com or check out our product comparisons and features </p>\n\n<p>www.vengeo.com/vortex-view/Vengeo_Inc/VengeoProductCompetitors</p>\n\n<p>http://www.vengeo.com/html5/Vengeo<em>Inc/Brochure</em>Main</p>"

      "<p>Tailgate Technologies, headquartered in London, UK, is a technology company that offers advertising solutions for all stakeholders in the online advertising value chain. </p>\n\n<p>Tailgate™ technology turns any online advertising unit into a direct point of sale by providing a clever bridge between the ad unit and the brand owner&#8217;s own e-commerce system. The company&#8217;s mission is to change the way consumers interact with and buy services and products from advertisers, enabling advertisers to close the gap between marketing and sales.  Advertisers can benefit from 15 per cent customer interaction rates with a 1–3 per cent conversion rate, while site owners benefit from higher visitor retention rates as the consumer doesn&#8217;t have to leave the site he or she is browsing in order to make a purchase.</p>\n\n<p>Tailgate Technologies is managed by young professionals with a clear vision and understanding of the advertising space. The company was founded by Christopher Autry, its current CEO, a veteran internet industry professional, management consultant and a one time biochemist.</p>\n\n<p>The company has partnered with leading brands such as the major Hollywood Studios, global retailers and third party agencies to promote their respective services and products to potential customers on the Internet.</p>\n\n<p>How it works:</p>\n\n<p>Tailgate treats advertising as a self-contained application. This encompasses the entire electronic commerce value chain into a single unit and appears as a traditional Internet advertising banner, video or widget, but with the capability to perform secure financial transactions using payment gateways.</p>\n\n<p>Tailgate™, a patent pending technology, utilises standard Internet application platforms such as Flash or Ajax to create a presentation layer for the advertising content and proprietary techniques to securely communicate with the advertiser&#8217;s electronic commerce database, as well as with the trusted payment gateway in use. The units provide 256-bit SSL security protocols in conjunction with numerous proprietary encryption protocols for each transaction, to guarantee the user&#8217;s security and privacy. User information is never stored or held and is deleted in 90 seconds if the information is not processed by the receiving e-commerce provider. The security framework is fully PCI compliant and meets all international security standards. Additionally, California-based Verisign secures the secure socket layer connection from the units to the main e-commerce Web server and payment gateway used.</p>"

After trying to solve this problem in traditional ways (Outlook, Excel spreadsheets, todos, etc), they found everything out there was too cumbersome or time consuming, and nothing was built around the new social capabilities of the web. </p>"

      "<p>SureSpeak is a web based coaching platform aimed at solving the current inefficiencies and costs associated with corporate training.</p>\n\n<p>The Problem</p>\n\n<p>Companies spend billions of dollars each year on training and coaching-in 2006 over $129 billion. However, this training is often ineffective or very expensive or both. </p>\n\n<p>Ineffective-Studies show that after 4 weeks, 85% of what was learned in a classroom setting is forgotten. Additionally, teaching interpersonal and communication skills in a classroom environment is rarely effective. Lastly, scheduling conflicts often cause inefficiency and delay in connecting a person in need of coaching and a coach. </p>\n\n<p>Expensive - Companies spend money on travel, lodging, meals and other related costs in order to get people to training sessions. Companies also deploy e-learning solutions which offer little or no interaction or practice and suffer from miserable completion rates.</p>\n\n<p>Additionally, current market conditions have caused the majority of enterprises to cut training and travel budgets significantly and look for cost effective means to deliver training enterprise-wide.</p>\n\n<p>The Solution</p>\n\n<p>SureSpeak is a Software as a Service (SaaS) provider of web-based video coaching platform and tools. Executive coaches &amp; enterprises use SureSpeak to improve sales, presentation and communication skills leading to enhanced revenues, higher customer retention and improved operating efficiencies. SureSpeak users watch modeling videos that demonstrate desired performance â€“ for example â€œHow to close the saleâ€. Then with just an internet connection and a webcam, the user records their version and self-reviews. Typically the user will re-record multiple times until satisfied (current record to save ratio is 6:1). Practicing or role-playing in a private setting has proven to be very desirable for SureSpeak users as opposed to group role-playing which is embarrassing and counter-productive. When the user is satisfied with his â€œSureSpeakâ€ he saves, and his coach receives an automatic email alert notifying him that a SureSpeak is waiting for review. The coach then logs in from wherever he may be and whenever he has time. This is a key to the efficiency of SureSpeak. The coach provides feedback in written form, in score format â€“ based on customizable categories such as â€œbody languageâ€, â€œtoneâ€, â€œenthusiasmâ€, â€œmessage contentâ€, â€œsincerityâ€, etc. The coach also can record a video back to the user. When the coach saves his feedback the system notifies the user that his score SureSpeak has been reviewed, and likewise the user logs in when convenient to review. Additionally, each user can receive feedback from unlimited coaches, peers, managers, etc.</p>\n\n<p>SureSpeakâ€™s patented platform is unique in that it is asynchronous â€“ meaning the practice and coaching is split up into 3 distinct parts â€“ practice, coaching/feedback, and review of feedback. These can be done independent of each other without delay and at any time. Most training fails in that no video record is provided and if it is not efficient or readily accessible online and cannot be shared. Synchronous training solutions such as video-conference fail as they still require both parties to be available at the same time.</p>"

Fundamentally, Smart Capacity solutions enable operators to improve the utilization and performance of their existing network capacity as subscriber data traffic continues to escalate.</p>\n\n<p>Numerous operators worldwide have experienced increasing pressure on capacity as a result of traffic congestion caused by faster networks, more sophisticated devices, richer content, and consumer demand for bandwidth-intensive applications such as high-definition (HD) video, streaming media, and one-to-one video communications (video chat). This trend, which has impacted operatorsâ€™ data revenue growth and profitability, is expected to continue with the commercial roll-out of Long Term Evolution (LTE) and other 4G networks.</p>\n\n<p>Bytemobileâ€™s products are designed to deliver Smart Capacity to mobile networks â€“ without the traditional requirement for new wireless spectrum or infrastructure build-out. The principal benefits to operators are: 1) better control of network capital and operating costs in the face of increasing traffic congestion; and 2) consistently higher quality of experience (QoE) for subscriber s accessing video and web services on mobile devices. Superior QoE leads to improved customer acquisition, retention, service adoption, and data usage â€“ and therefore increased revenue growth.</p>\n\n<p>Bytemobile offers operators two Smart Capacity platforms: 1) the Unison(TM) Platform, which is carrier-grade software deployed on industry-standard server hardware for processing video and web traffic through mobile networks; and 2) the T3000 Adaptive Traffic Management System (T-Series), which consists of a fully integrated network element, deployed in the core, for managing traffic across Layers 2-7 of the network stack. Bytemobile Smart Capacity applications include video optimization, web optimization, content caching, policy control, traffic management, and network analytics.</p>\n\n<p>Bytemobile was founded in 2000 to optimize high-bandwidth data services on wireless networks designed for low-bandwidth voice services. In 2001, the company completed its first commercial network deployments. Today, Bytemobile has deployed more than 125 mobile network operators in over 60 countries. A few of the company&#8217;s customers are AT&amp;T, China Mobile, China Telecom, Cricket Communications, Deutsche Telekom, Indosat, MetroPCS, O2, Orange, TelefÃ³nica, TeliaSonera, and Vodafone.</p>\n\n<p>Bytemobile has global supply agreements in place with major telecommunications groups operating networks and serving subscribers across multiple geographic regions.

Due to the limited marketing power of these individual suppliers, Rezgo has integrated a marketplace that handles commission and net rate relationships with a growing list of vendors. Suppliers are able to apply for distribution relationships through the marketplace, called RezgoConnect, and if there is a fit, the supplier&#8217;s products will be sold through the resellers distribution channels. </p>\n\n<p>Rezgo is a pay-for-performance model which means suppliers only pay for the system if they receive a booking.  The fee for using Rezgo is 5%.  Tour operators anticipating or experiencing high volume sales are welcomed to negotiate a different long-term  rate. </p>"

Clubbyclub provides a private and safe place for friend groups like student clubs, schoolmates and sport teams.</p>\n\n<p>Privacy assured\nMore and more companies screen candidates on social networks. A picture with a lot of beer and you posing in a drunk mood on your profile or friendâ€™s profile may cost you a job. Clubbyclub is built for friends to provide a private and safe place on the net. This also means that you can not find members or groups on this website. Only members of a private group can visit their online place with a secret username and password. Through these measures Clubbyclub protects the privacy of their members. </p>\n\n<p>Private groups\nThis new website is mainly built for fun with the assurance that your ex, boss or mother-in-law will not be sneaking around your pictures and other material. So personal and mostly funny pictures, videos, links and messages will only be shared with your real friends. Clubbyclub is not a website to meet new people, but gives existing friend groups a clear and reliable place on the internet. Fake friends can not knock on the door. Of course social networks offer a private service to make your profile only visible for friends or friendâ€™s friends, but only 7% of the internet users uses this option and thereby most of your friends on these social networks are not your real friends. Your cousin, your classmate from 2nd grade or your colleague are usually not your real friends </p>\n\n<p>The members of a friend group now have one central place to share private messages, photos and videos. This is lively place to communicate with your friends without using email. Everyone within the same club is updated concerning all relevant and funny happenings in life.</p>"
